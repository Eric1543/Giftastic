# Giftastic

Giftastic is a dynamic webpage with a wrestling theme. 

The initial website provides a group of clickable wrestler buttons that when clicked on, will generate a call to the giphy API, 
and then render the results as 10 static GIFS of uniform height with different widths. 
Clicking on each static GIF will animate it on a loop, while clicking on an animated GIF will make it static.

The other dynamic portions are the buttons, which allow the visitor to add more of his/her favorite wrestlers and also the displayed GIFS 
area, which will empty and repopulate per button click.
